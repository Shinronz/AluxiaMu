-----------------------------------------------------
Instructions for building, testing and releasing GLEE
-----------------------------------------------------

GENERATING DATA
- everything from Data/GLeeXMLGenInput/Specs/headers and /extspecs
- run graball.bat to grab headers and specs to DATA/GLeeXMLGenInput/Specs
- Run GLeeXMLGen to generate XML files

GENERATING SOURCE 
- Edit the version number and copyright year in readme.txt, gleeGen.cpp and license.txt and GLeeVersion.txt
- Run GleeGen to generate GLee.c and GLee.h in /DATA/output

WINDOWS
- Build GLeeLib to build GLee.lib for windows (Build the RELEASE version) 
- Build and run GLeeTest to test

LINUX
- edit package.sh and update the .tar.gz version number
- Run VM
- cd /mnt/hgfs/DOnBen/p4/GLee/GLeeScripts/linux
- run ./package.sh to copy all the needed files to DATA/outputLinux and create the .tar.gz
- run ./test.sh to build the shared library

  TODO! this step builds the shared library. Use it to build redist and binary tarballs

MAC
- compile and run GLeeTestMac in XCode
- step into render function and check initialisation works

RELEASING
- Edit prepareForRelease.bat and update the zip file version number
- cd to GLeeScripts/publish/

- Run prepareForRelease.bat to copy the following files to the RELEASE folder (this will clean the folder first)
   DATA/outputLinux/GLeeX_Y.tar.gz
   DATA/output/GLeeX_Y.zip
   DATA/output/readme.txt
   DATA/output/extensionList.txt
   
NOTES
- GLeeXMLGen does not (yet) automatically grab new types etc. These need to be manually added to exceptions.txt
- Problematic extensions can be ignored by adding to the list in GLExtIgnore.txt
- The GLeeXMLGen will by default use extensions from the headers over the ones from the specs. To override this behaviour 
  for specific extensions, add it to HeaderIgnore.txt
- Extension specs can be overridden with the PatchedSpecs directory. Specs found in here will override downloaded versions. 
  This is useful for fixing up nvidia's non-standard specs so they actually work, for example
